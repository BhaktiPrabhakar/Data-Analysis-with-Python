__What is EDA ?__<br>
EDA is a phenomenon under data analysis used for gaining a better understanding of data aspects like main features of data, variables and relationships that hold between them, identifying which variables are important for our problem<br>

Exploratory Data Analysis or (EDA) is understanding the data sets by summarizing their main characteristics often plotting them visually.
